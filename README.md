### 🔍 Business Overview

This project evaluates the financial feasibility of **Veytran Estate**, a 120-unit multifamily residential property, modeled over a 10-year holding period. The objective is to determine whether the investment generates adequate returns using key real estate finance metrics such as IRR, NPV, Equity Multiple, and Payback Period.

The Excel-based model incorporates assumptions for rental income, operating costs, loan structure, and an exit strategy via a cap rate sale. It serves as a decision-making tool for investors and asset managers.

### 📊 Investment Summary Dashboard

| **Metric**              | **Result**         | **Interpretation**                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NPV @ 10% Discount**  | **(\$986,391.68)** | The investment destroys nearly \$1M in value using a 10% required return. |
| **IRR**                 | **-3%**            | Indicates the deal underperforms and erodes investor capital.             |
| **Equity Multiple**     | **0.75x**          | Returns only 75% of the initial investment — a 25% loss.                  |
| **Total Cash Inflow**   | **\$2,963,608.32** | Total projected return over 10 years, including the exit.                 |
| **Net Profit**          | **(\$986,391.68)** | Equity remains unrecovered throughout the project.                        |
| **Payback Period**      | **Not Recovered**  | Cash flow never accumulates enough to repay the initial investment.       |
| **Average Annual CFBT** | **\~\$296,361**    | Cash flows are steady but insufficient to make the deal viable.           |

### 🧠 Skills Demonstrated in the Modeling

By developing this model and dashboard, the following skills were applied:

#### 📊 **Advanced Excel & Financial Modeling**

* Built a **dynamic 10-year cash flow forecast** using Excel.
* Used key formulas: `NPV`, `IRR`, `PMT`, `IF`, and `SUMPRODUCT`.
* Structured **discounted cash flow (DCF)** analysis for project valuation.
* Modeled **debt amortization** and calculated annual debt service.
* Calculated **exit terminal value** using cap rate logic.

#### 📐 **Real Estate Finance**

* Computed **Net Operating Income (NOI)** from gross rent, vacancy, and expenses.
* Determined **Equity Multiple**, **CFBT**, and **Payback Period**.
* Integrated **exit strategy** using projected Year 10 NOI and a 5.5% cap rate.

#### 📊 **Excel Table Presentation**

* Showed a **Table layout** with summary metrics and formatted visuals.
* Used conditional formatting to highlight losses and positive cash flow trends.
* Structured output for investor decision-making and presentation.

### 🔎 Analysis Summary

Despite showing positive operating cash flows year-over-year, the Veytran Estate project **fails to meet minimum investor return thresholds**. A **-3% IRR** and **negative NPV** suggest that the capital invested would have been better allocated elsewhere.

The key issues are:

* The acquisition cost and closing costs are too high relative to income potential.
* Rent growth and cash flow do not scale fast enough.
* The terminal value (exit price) is insufficient to rescue the deal.

### ✅ Strategic Recommendations

To improve the investment performance:

| 📌 **Area**              | ⚙️ **Improvement Action**                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rent Growth**          | Increase rents or apply 4–5% annual growth to reflect inflation and market trends. |
| **Exit Cap Rate**        | Model at a 5.0% cap rate to enhance terminal value.                                |
| **Purchase Price**       | Lower acquisition cost by \$750K–\$1M to reduce equity requirement.                |
| **Operating Efficiency** | Reduce operating ratio to 30% or below through better cost control.                |
| **Leverage**             | Seek better loan terms — lower rate or interest-only period.                       |

### 📦 Conclusion

The Veytran Estate model is technically sound and well-structured, demonstrating strong use of Excel, real estate finance, and modeling logic. While the current deal underperforms with a **negative IRR** and unrecovered equity, the modeling approach is highly adaptable. With adjusted assumptions, this could be repositioned as a profitable investment.

The analysis not only quantifies the deal’s weaknesses but also provides a data-driven roadmap for turning it around.
